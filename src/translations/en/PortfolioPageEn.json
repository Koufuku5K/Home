        "paragraph2": "Art comes in many shapes and forms: paintings, sculptures, music, films, literature, and many more. However, although the popularity of video games are rising, it is still not widely accepted as a form of art.",
        "paragraph3": "I have always been fascinated by video games since I was young. One of the games that left a huge impression on me was Pok√©mon Platinum on the Nintendo DS. It is one of the reasons why I grew to love video games.",
        "paragraph4": "Back then, video games are a form of entertainment yet it evolved in such a fast pace into what it is now. I believe that video games are just like movies, but interactive. This allows us to interact and to be more immersed in the narrative of the game.",
        "paragraph5": "As a game engineer, I aim to contribute to the game industry by being involved in the creation of superb, interactive, and memorable video games in order to bring the values of video games to light!"
